# fileIO

## Start

start by figuring out how to read and close a file, should be able to do open and close

## figure out how to get the values

i can use two ints, n and j for this, where we first read the line and separate the two parts by the comma, then add the values to get the total number of iterations

We can use a loop to stay on the same line, a while loop, and a for loop to print the word for the iterations
